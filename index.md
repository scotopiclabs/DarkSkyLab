**ScotopicLabs** is a small company specialized in two specific areas:
- Light pollution and its impacts on ecosystems;
- Embedded astronomy systems.

# Light Pollution
In the past few years, public awareness about the impact of light pollution on ecosystems and human health has gained importance. This has resulted into a desire to better adjust the public lighting systems to the needs of the populations and to educate the public to the economical and environmental implications of light pollution.

For its activities around light pollution studies, ScotopicLabs is partnering with [DarkSkyLab](https://darkskylab.com/index.html) to form a motivated team with complementary skills: electronic design, software development, delivery capabilities, deep knowledge of the challenges around light pollution, etc. ScotopicLabs is specifically in charge of developping **Otus**, a software to model and simulate light pollution, as well as the software part of an integrated platform called **Ninox** to measure and monitor night sky brightness over long periods of time. These tools are used to deliver services ranging from consulting for communities and companies wishing to improve the quality of their lighting and achieve energy savings to in-depth scientific studies around light pollution and its environmental impact.

# Embedded Astronomy Systems
An other facet of ScotopicLabs activities is around integrated systems for astronomy. Its focus is to develop low consumption embedded systems to be used by professional and amateur astronomers: telescope control, autoguiding, remote observatory management, high-speed image acquisition, etc. The common denominator of these systems is that they are based on nanocomputers which offer today the required level of integration, flexibility, reliability and power consumption to deliver a unique value for the field of astronomy.
